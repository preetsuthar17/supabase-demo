# Supabase Project Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of a JavaScript project that utilizes Supabase for the database. The project allows users to enter their Todo and save them in the database.

## Prerequisites

> Set up your Supabase SQL before continuing this work.
> For more information about using Supabase, refer to the official Supabase documentation: [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.io/docs).

Before running the project, please ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js, you can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org).

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/preetsuthar17/supabase-demo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-project
   ```
3. Install project dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

### Creating a table in the database

1. Go to the Supabase dashboard and login yourself.

2. Go to SQL editor
   <img src="./img/table-generation-1.png" alt="SQL editor"/>

3. Create a new blank query and paste the below code in there,

```SQL
CREATE TABLE todoreg (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  todo TEXT
);
```

5. After pasting code run the code.
   <img src="./img/table-generation-2.png" alt="run query"/>

This will successfully generate a table in SQL, you can continue other steps now.

Head over to code now.

Before running the project, you need to configure the Supabase URL and key in the `index.js file. Open the `index.js` file and locate the following lines:

```javascript
const supabaseUrl = "{your_supabase_url}";
const supabaseKey = "{your_supabase_key}";
```

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can run it using the following command:

```shell
node index.js
```

<video controls width="250">
    <source src="./img/demo-vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<img src="./img/demo.png" alt="demo" >

When executed, the code will prompt you to enter your Name. Please provide your name as instructed, and it will be saved in the Supabase database table named "name-reg".
